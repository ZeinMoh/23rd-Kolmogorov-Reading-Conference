# 23rd-Kolmogorov-Reading-Conference
This repository contains our work for the 23rd Kolmogorov Reading Conference in Mathematical Modeling and Computer Science section. Project name: Design and Implementation of a Robotic System for Medical Assistance in Hospitals. Award received: Diploma 3rd degree.
Note: the report is incomplete (e.g., needs further explanations in the mechanical part, and improving the ideas delivery), the conference only required a presentation and video of the projectâ€™s work (every year the requirements change and vary based on project and section).
